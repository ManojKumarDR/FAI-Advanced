Angular is a JS Framework developed by Google for creating Rich UI-based Apps that run on multiple devices and Platforms. The latest version is 14. Google releases new versions once in 6 months. Most of the features will be enhancement of the App build and execution with little features also added up. Most of the enhancements will be on the optimization of the Code that is generated by Angular.

Angular uses Components to make up the Application. A Component in Angular is a self-contained unit that has all the requirements of a UI that will run on a Browser. HTML + CSS + Logical Code that is created using a Sp language called TypeScript. TS is an MS product, that works like an Enhanced version of JS. It is more typesafe than JS. 

Angular Apps are developed using a Boiler-plate code that is generated using Command line tools provided by Angular.

### Software requirements for Angular:
1. NodeJS installed in UR Machine. Nodejs acts like a web server for the development environment of Angular App.
2. Install the Angular CLI Command Utility using Node Package Manager.   
   "
      npm install -g @angular-cli
   " 

### Commands for creating Angular App
- ng new app-name ==> Creates a new App with a wizard support in a folder named on the app name. 
- cd app-name ==>Move to the directory of the App
- ng serve --open ==>Builds the App, runs it and opens it in the default browser of the System.

### Features:
1. It is used for creating Single Page Apps. There will be only one Main HTML page called as Index that makes UR App.
2. It uses Components, independent self-contained units that will make up UR Application. UR App will comprise of 100s of components that will be having its own html, css, unittesting code as well as the Logical code behind that contains the event handlers for the html elements.
3. Unit Testing is one of the features of Angular where U can have Unit testing done on each of the functionality of the Angular component. It also supports e2e(End to End) Testing using an Automation testing framework called Protractor. Jasmine is the testing framework for unit testing. 
4. Data Binding is a very popular feature where we can bind the data of the component the User interface represented as HTML Content. Default is one-way binding. The binding happens from TS file to the html file
